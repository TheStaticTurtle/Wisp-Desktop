# Wisp
Wisp is a NodeJS audiobook reader. It's using Electron and VueJS offering a great compatibility across platforms. It is still under development and anyone that wants to contribute to this project is welcome.
Furthermore, it first started as a playground for me to learn electron and improve my VueJS so the code might not be up to everyone standard

**When running in development mode, the database will reset at each launch. This, however is disabled will running in production.**

# Launching / Building

Thanks to the vue electron builder module launching the project is done with the command `npm electron:serve` and build the project is done with `npm electron:build`. But be warned I did not test build in a platform other than windows and tho some build options might be missing from the `vue.config.js` file
